# to-do-list
Scenario:
In the fast-paced academic environment, university students juggle multiple responsibilities, including assignments, discussions, club activities, and examinations. To effectively manage their time and prioritize their tasks, a well-structured To-Do List web application is required as an assistant to the students. This assignment requires you to develop a web application that is tailored to university students with the maximum number of web pages is between 10-15 pages. Note that the pop-up dialog box is not considered as a web page.

The web application must cover the following features:
•	Task Recording where users can add tasks such as assignments, discussions, club activities, and examinations. Each task must include title, description, due date, and category.
•	Task Monitoring where users can view all their tasks in a structured way with filtering options that allow sorting by category, priority, or due date.
•	Task Status Management that can be marked as "On-going," "Pending," or "Completed."
•	Task Archiving where the completed tasks are moved to an archive instead of being permanently deleted and users can revisit archived tasks if necessary.
•	Task Prioritization where tasks can be assigned with the priority levels such as "High," "Medium," or "Low." that can help students focus on urgent tasks first.
•	Reminder System to notify students of approaching deadlines and users can set custom notifications based on their preferences.
